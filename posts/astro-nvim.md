I'm switching to [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/) from VS Code.

Why?

- I'm already using VIM bindings with VS Code, so the switching will be a breeze (hopefully!)
- VS Code is too slow for projects at scale.
- AstroNvim has a nice package of plugins equivalent to VSCode extensions including GH Copilot.
- I've tried to create my flavor over the [years](https://github.com/rajikaimal/dotfiles/tree/master/vim), yet I prefer AstroNvim for now.

Alternatives?

- [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
- [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/)
- [Zed](https://zed.dev/) seems promising too, but their VIM bindings are not complete yet
