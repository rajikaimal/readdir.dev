AI (LLMs) have become an essential tool for software engineers to build applications.
We're in the era of software engineering becoming AI native engineers. In this day and age, we're orchestrating AI to build applications.

## What skill is most important for AI native software engineers? 

Code reviewing is the most important skill for AI native software engineers. AI can write a lot of code. It can review code too. But it's not perfect. This is where engineers should step as a orchestrator in the process of SDLC. While a lot of straightforward reviews can be done with AI, there are complex reviews that AI can't handle. These reviews depend on the context of the codebase, the project, and the team.

## How to improve code reviewing skills?

- Always review your own PRs, before submitting for peer reviews
- Try to review PRs from other engineers, even though it may not be 100% relevant to your work
- Grasp the patterns in your team's codebase
- Read open source codebases
