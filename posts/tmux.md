tmux has been in my dev workflow for a brief time. However, at the time I wasn't fully comfortable with vim.

Now that I've used vim (neovim/VSCode with vim bindings), I've switched to tmux to manage windows primarily.

[tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) is a handy plugin manager to install tmux plugins.
