title: "Optimizing the dev workflow with LLMs"

I'm extremely bullish on being more productive with LLMs such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot.
I've started producing more output in a meaningful manner with these tools.

## ChatGPT

- Helps to find answers directly without navigating links. However as a developer you can't
  blindly trust LLMs. This is where you come in as a the human interpreter of the results.
- Unit tests.
- [Regex](https://twitter.com/davidbyttow/status/1639679641161015301) (HUGE!)
- Optimizing functions

## GitHub Copilot

- Boilerplate code
- Straighforward function logic suggestions (I guess this is part of boilerplate code?)
- Drafting complex functions

Pretty excited about [Copilot X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RfD5JiXt3A).
