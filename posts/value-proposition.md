Types of engineers,

- Specialists - Specialize in a particular area, eg: Front-end, Back-end, DevOps, SRE etc.
- Generalists - Full-stack generalists.

## My value proposition

Right now, I consider myself as a generalist. I've always wanted to explore end-to-end of stacks and understand how systems work. At certain points I've considered becoming a specialist, but I always get bored when working on the same thing for a prolonged period of time. This doesn't mean I don't believe in specialists. They are so important for highly complex systems.

Being a generalist allows you to build products end-to-end. This skill is useful for product companies at early stage.

## What about LLMs (AI)?

At the time of writing, LLMs can mimick what generalists and specialists can do to a certain extent. However I don't believe they'll replace generalists or specialists in near future. Instead they'll act as [co-pilots](https://theruntime.dev/optimizing-the-workflow) for both generalists and specialists.
