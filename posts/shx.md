[shx](https://github.com/rajikaimal/shx) is a simple CLI tool to quickly find commands without leaving the terminal. shx calls a Cloudflare Workers AI instance, which uses [llama3](https://blog.cloudflare.com/meta-llama-3-available-on-cloudflare-workers-ai/) as the model to generate responses. The Cloudflare Worker streams the response back to the CLI client.
